CeaserCipher 
Save the code: Save the code in a Python file with a .py extension (e.g., caesar_cipher.py).

Run the code: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, run the code using the command python caesar_cipher.py.

Enter your message: A window will appear with labeled fields. In the "Message" field, type the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.

Choose a shift value: Enter a numerical shift value in the "Shift value" field. This value determines how many positions each letter in the message will be shifted.

Select the mode: Use the dropdown menu labeled "Mode" to choose whether you want to "encrypt" or "decrypt" the message.

Click the button: Click the "Encrypt/Decrypt" button to perform the operation.

View the output: The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed in the "Output" field below the button.

Key points:

Integer shift values: The shift value must be an integer (whole number). Entering a non-integer value will cause an error.
Encryption and decryption: The code can be used for both encryption and decryption, depending on the selected mode.
Case sensitivity: The code preserves the case of the letters in the original message.
Non-letter characters: Non-letter characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation) are not shifted and remain unchanged in the output.
Additional tips:

Experiment with different shift values to try various encryptions.
Use the "decrypt" mode to reveal the original message from an encrypted one.
Consider creating a more interactive and customizable GUI with additional features if desired.
